# CPNT 262 Activity 5 Server Side Logic

## Code Journal

I use a lot of this assignment from the activity we did in class but also with the package.json on how to fill that out, and make sure everything was correct was a bit easier for me as we did it for one of Temi's classes so I remember that one easily.

A bug I came across was that my about.html wasn't working in the server and it kept giving me a 404. I tried to look at our past activity to see if maybe I wasn't naming it correctly or there was a small syntax error. My error was literally, I forgot to call the about.html again once I created a 404.html. But also it took me longer to figure out because I needed to refresh my server then I knew when it was fixed eventually. I struggled with understanding how to throw errors, I knew how to try catch errors from our activity and just working in our mini assignments with group work but throwing errors, I thought it would be the same so I wasn't 100% sure about this.
